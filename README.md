# random-level-gen-gms2
A random level generation example (similar to Nuclear Throne) using GameMaker Studio 2.

This example project uses a DS Grid to generate a random level, then it fills the game room with tiles using the bitmasking method taught in this article: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-tile-bitmasking-to-auto-tile-your-level-layouts--cms-25673

Finally, it uses binary math to detect for collisions in the level's DS Grid.

Here is a screenshot:
